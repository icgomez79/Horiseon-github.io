Horiseon Website

To improve the existing website I did this:

In HTML:
Added comments between sections to facilitate the code reading.
Fixed the link for the search-engine-optimization changing the "div class "for "div id".
Added the "alt" values for each image to ensure accesibility.

IN CSS:
Consolidate
